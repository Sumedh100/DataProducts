## This page shows the locations of the Stores & Markets in Mumbai, India open during the LockDown Period of the CoronaVirus(COVID-19).

To check out the code and documentation for this webpage, check out this link to my gitHub repo : <https://github.com/Sumedh100/DataProducts>.

Note: Due to the lock-down, the number majority of the markets are close and thus only few points are shown on the map.
